# Cocoa-Bean-Imports-in-the-World
This project is the analysis of the data available for Cocoa Bean Imports from years 2015-2019. The data was taken from https://data.world/makeovermonday/2020w52.
This data has a data of amount of Cocoa Beans imported by three regions. Asia & Oceanic Regions, Asia and Europe over the years.

##In this project I have worked on three visualizations.##

**1. This visualization gives us the direct comparison of the amount of Cocoa Bean imported in each year.**

**2. This visualization gives us the individual percent share of each region for the total import of the Cocoa Beans in all the years.**

**3. This visualization gives us the trend of overall Cocoa Bean imports of the world for combined regions.**
