# Cocoa-Bean-Imports-in-the-World
This project is the analysis of the data available for Cocoa Bean Imports from years 2015-2019. The data was taken from https://data.world/makeovermonday/2020w52.
This data has a data of amount of Cocoa Beans imported by three regions. Asia & Oceania Regions, Americas and Europe over the years.

In this project I have worked on three visualizations.

***1. This visualization gives us the direct comparison of the amount of Cocoa Bean imported in each year.***

   This chart clearly shows that years after years, Europe is the leading region for the imports of the Cocoa Beans. From the chart, it is apparent that the imports by Europe is significantly higher than other regions. It is peculiar and warrants a study into the the reasons for this trend.

***2. This visualization gives us the individual percent share of each region for the total import of the Cocoa Beans in all the years.***

   This chart followed by the first one gives us the expected result of big chunk of contribution in imports by Europe. This chart gives us the numerical comparison of every region's imports. As seen, Europe has the maximum import share with 64% followed by around 20% by Asia and Oceania regions and lastly around 16% by Americas. The difference between these two regions is not much and is significantly below Europ's share.

***3. This visualization gives us the trend of overall Cocoa Bean imports of the world for combined regions.***

![Unknown-4](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/31748299/117650910-21eded00-b146-11eb-947e-0e6042016614.png)

   This gives us the trend of overall Cocoa Beans Imports which can give us the insight into the coffee consumption trends in the world which translates into a demand. As seen, the imports of Cocoa Beans increased  a lot faster until 2018, peaked in 2018 and then decreaed in 2019. It is not possible to conclusively say that the demand is decreasing as we will need data from atleast one more year to confirm the trend.
